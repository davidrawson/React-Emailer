# Emaily - A ReactJS and NodeJS web app.

## Compose and email surveys, and collate the responses.

### This app utilises:

- Google OAuth
- Stripe online payments
- SendGrid emailling service

The user can log in, purchase Emaily credits, compose surveys, email to multiple recipients, and display the results.

This app was created as part of Stephen Grider's **Node With React: Fullstack Web Development** course.

It is deployed to Heroku [here](https://floating-basin-29635.herokuapp.com/).  

Please note that the Stripe card payment is in Test Mode and that 'live' card details should not be used. Instead, use 4242424242424242 for the card number.
